# GoodReads Genre Comparisons

This is a github repository for a comparison of books across genres on goodreads. In particular we focused in on two metrics per book: Average Rating and Average Number of Ratings.

The data was downloaded from this kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books/version/3#

The most interesting file is the Analysis.ipynb notebook, that contains all of the relevant analysis to this project. The file MessyAnalysis.ipynb is also included as that's where I did most of the work, but is in general a lot more messier and was more of a playground for me to work in. The notebook Analysis.ipynb should run in order if you have numpy and scipy and matplotlib installed. The notebook MessyAnalysis.ipynb may not and may require executing things in weird orders. 

The images folder also contains all of the output from these notebooks.
